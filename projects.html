        I studied the community's attempt to engage with the FDA on the social platform X. The goal of this study was to understand whether the linguistic cues and rhetorical strategies used in the community's posts demonstrate characteristics of collective intelligence. To address this, I used the linguistic model of stance and engagement and conducted six months of digital ethnography to deeply understand the community's communicative practices. I also examined established factors of collective intelligence to assess whether, and in what ways, the community could be considered an instance of collective intelligence. Together, these methods led to the development of a codebook that captures the community's rhetorical strategies when attempting to interact with institutions on a social platform.

        I collaborated on a study led by BSMS student Carly Atwell to investigate how the ALS community uses an official platform, Regulations.gov, to contribute feedback on FDA's policy drafts. The platform is intended to give the public a channel for sharing opinions that policymakers can incorporate into policy revisions. For this study, we analyzed the full dataset of public comments submitted on an ALS-related policy draft. Using thematic analysis, we coded each comment and categorized phrases as criticism, recommendation, information, or claims about ALS. We then grouped the criticisms and recommendations into three major themes: Drug development regulatory processes, clinical trials, and patient participation/Input. Furthermore, we examined which community inputs actually led to changes in the policy document. One key finding was that commenters frequently requested greater transparency in the process, expressing uncertainty about whether their feedback was genuinely considered. Based on such insights, we proposed design implications for making policy-making processes more transparent and accountable to the public.

        I am currently studying the scientific visualizations that the ALS community shares on social media to support different arguments. The community frequently reuses scientific visualizations originally produced by institutions such as the FDA, treating them as evidence to support claims or challenge decisions. For this work, my focus goes beyond assessing whether people interpret the scientific visualizations "correctly." Instead, I aim to understand how individuals use these visual representations to communicate their needs, values, and concerns. The broader goal of the project is to explore whether scientific representations can be designed in ways that integrate both experiential knowledge from communities and institutional knowledge from experts.
