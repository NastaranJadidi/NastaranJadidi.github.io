        I studied the community's attempt to engage with the FDA on the social platform X. The goal of this study was to understand whether the linguistic cues and rhetorical strategies used in the community's posts demonstrate characteristics of collective intelligence. To address this, I used the linguistic model of stance and engagement and conducted six months of digital ethnography to deeply understand the community's communicative practices. I also examined established factors of collective intelligence to assess whether, and in what ways, the community could be considered an instance of collective intelligence. Together, these methods led to the development of a codebook that captures the community's rhetorical strategies when attempting to interact with institutions on a social platform.

        I collaborated with BSMS student Carly Atwell on a study examining how the ALS community engages with FDA policy drafts through Regulations.gov. We analyzed public comments on an ALS-related policy, coding them thematically and tracking which inputs influenced policy revisions. A key finding was that commenters frequently expressed uncertainty about whether their feedback was genuinely considered, leading us to propose design implications for making policy-making processes more transparent and accountable to the public.

        I led a study, alongside undergraduate student Megan Genetti, examining knowledge-seeking practices during pregnancy. Through interviews with 14 participants, we identified various operations pregnant people perform when seeking, evaluating, and using information across different aspects of pregnancy. A key finding revealed that factual information itself is not the primary driver of information-seeking behavior.

        I am currently studying the scientific visualizations that the ALS community shares on social media to support different arguments. The community frequently reuses scientific visualizations originally produced by institutions such as the FDA, treating them as evidence to support claims or challenge decisions. For this work, my focus goes beyond assessing whether people interpret the scientific visualizations "correctly." Instead, I aim to understand how individuals use these visual representations to communicate their needs, values, and concerns. The broader goal of the project is to explore whether scientific representations can be designed in ways that integrate both experiential knowledge from communities and institutional knowledge from experts.
